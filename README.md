# Electronic-Bird-Deterrent-Project
Bird damage to crops poses a serious threat to numerous communities, especially those that depend heavily on agriculture. This AFRETEC project proposes an AI-based system that, upon detecting the presence of a bird, emits a non-harmful high-frequency sound that repels birds while remaining imperceptible to humans. My focus was on the actuator. From literature review, ultrasonic sounds are ineffective (hearing bandwith of most birds overlaps with that of humans), and a deterrent mechanism needs to be multi-modal. Hence, audible sounds and Safe laser repellent were incorporated in the project.
